  A simple Rust WASM Game of Life implementation by [Matthew Tromp](https://github.com/MatthewTromp), [Isaac Awasi Oppong Jr](https://github.com/akwasiio), and myself for the initial pair programming project. So fun!
</div>

## 🚴 Usage


Built for use with Node version 16 

```
cargo build
wasm-pack build
cd www
npm install
npm run start
```


## 🔋 Batteries Included

- `.gitignore`: ignores `node_modules`
- `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`: most Rust projects are licensed this way, so these are included for you
- `README.md`: the file you are reading now!
- `index.html`: a bare bones html document that includes the webpack bundle
- `index.js`: example js file with a comment showing how to import and use a wasm pkg
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`:
  - pulls in devDependencies for using webpack:
      - [`webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)
      - [`webpack-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli)
      - [`webpack-dev-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server)
  - defines a `start` script to run `webpack-dev-server`
- `webpack.config.js`: configuration file for bundling your js with webpack
